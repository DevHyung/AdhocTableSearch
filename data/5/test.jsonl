Van Gogh depicted the sower in \"its simplest form\" and with the colors of blue, red, yellow, purple and orange, giving life and meaning to the composition of the eternal cycles of life. The Sower 1850 Museum of Fine Arts, Boston The Sower 1889 Kroller-Muller Museum (F689) Van Gogh's appreciation for Millet's work stemmed from the soulfulness he brought to the works, specifically honoring peasants' agricultural role. Plowing, sowing, and harvesting were seen by Van Gogh as symbols for man's command of nature and its eternal cycles of life. Kay Larson of \"New York Magazine\" wrote of Millet's work: The Sower, who strides like an elemental force of nature across the cold, newly broken earth, is such an icon that Simon and Schuster uses it as a logo.\"  The Reaper 1889 Private Collection (F688) [Scythe|scythe]  [Van_Gogh_Museum|Van Gogh Museum] Of making this painting, and others of Millet's Work in the Field series, Van Gogh mentioned that absent models, he was pleased to have seven of the ten in the series completed.  Peasant Woman with a Rake 1889 Private collection (F698)   [Van_Gogh_Museum|Van Gogh Museum] In Peasant Woman Binding Sheaves (after Millet) Van Gogh's work shows it is beautiful for its simplicity and appreciation of nature. The woman's expression is hidden to us and appears like one of the waiting bundles of wheat. The true focus of the scene is the woman's bent back.

Its strong contour line was the inspiration for Vincent van Gogh's Sorrow.  Woman Spinning 1889 Collection Sara and Moshe Mayer, Geneva, Switzerland (F696)  Winter: The Plain of Chailly 1862 Osterreichische Gallerie, Vienna [Van_Gogh_Museum|Van Gogh Museum] Van Gogh used Millet's work, and Alfred Delaunay's etching of Millet's work, as inspiration for this painting. In Van Gogh's version he added black crows and made the winter scene more bleak, deserted and cold. His choice of color, composition and brushstroke make this work uniquely his own.  [Z\u00fcrich|Z\u00fcrich] Van Gogh used the women from Millet's The Gleaners as inspiration for this painting of women digging in the frozen snow. Unlike the others, this work is not a literal translation of the original painting. The setting sun casts a warm glow over the fields of snow.

As an example, a 5/1 ARM means that the initial interest rate applies for five years (or 60 months, in terms of payments), after which the interest rate is adjusted annually.
