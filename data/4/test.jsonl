Is a foreign or British insurer who holds a license under the Quebec Insurance Act to carry on business within the Province obliged to observe and subject to Sections 11, 12, 65 and 66 of the Insurance Act of Canada, or are these Sections unconstitutional as regards such insurer? 2.

Twentieth Century Fox Corporation Limited and others [1939 UKPC 68] In 1892 a song entitled \u201cThe Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo\u201d was published in London. It consisted of three verse, with a chorus and was written and composed by Fred Gilbert. Many people remember the original publication. Both words and music were of the most commonplace character, but the music went with a jaunty swing performed by Charles Coborn. The song consisting of words and music was duly registered at Stationers Hall in London and acquired copyright under the Copyright Act of 1842. But the performing right was not acquired, because of the failure to comply with the conditions imposed by the English Copyright (Musical Compositions) Act, 1882, which required that the proprietor of the copyright if he desired to acquire and retain the right of public representation or performance should print upon the title page of every published copy a notice to the effect that the right of public representation or performance was reserved.

It should now work under Windows and Mac OS X. 2.0.2 2001 August 10 The UI has been rewritten to be very simple and easier to use. 2.1 2001 August 23 A fix for a serious problem which was keeping it from using a whole net connection, a complete rewrite of Downloader.py, and other minor tweaks. 2.2 2001 September 2 Several major changes were made to the protocol, which is now frozen. 2.3.1 2001 September 12 This release has extensive user feedback and download resuming. 2.5 2001 October 23 UI was rewritten. It is now completely graphical and works in mozilla/netscape under UNIX. Monothreading was added which gave vast performance increases. The publisher now stores metadata in files, so it doesn't have to re-scan files every time it restarts, and the tracker now stores publisher and downloader information persistently, so downloads start working again as soon as it restarts. A clean shutdown, small improvements, and bugfixes added. 2.6.1 2002 January 6 For this release, the upload/download logic was thoroughly rewritten to use a tit-for-tat bandwidth trading strategy. Usage of TCP buffering was also greatly improved. Unix installation was simplified, and many small improvements were added. 2.6.2 2002 March 18 The UI is much nicer, and now looks like a real GUI. There are a huge number of small stability and performance enhancements, none of them directly impacting the interface. 2.7 2002 April 29 Major performance enhancements, including peers reciprocating uploads more responsively. Significant UI enhancements were made, including progress meters on file allocation and resuming. Much better error-handling and multi-file support were added, so multiple files can be downloaded with a single click. The protocol has been reworked to be much more secure, and now uses a fixed port. This should be the last backwards-incompatible release. Several major bugs were also fixed. 2.7.1 2002 April 30 A massive bug in the last release has been fixed. That one barely worked at all; this one is much better. 2.7.2 2002 May 6 In this release, the tracker has been rewritten to use asynchronous I/O, so it no longer has the hanging problems which plagued it before. 2.8.0 2002 May 31 Huge internal performance improvements, changes to the protocol to substantially reduce overhead, and Tracker now keeps track of which peers are still up, greatly improving scaling. 2.8.1 2002 June 5 A crippling bug in the download logic has been fixed. It should scale comfortably to thousands of simultaneous downloaders now. 2.9 2002 July 2 This release contains major performance enhancements and bugfixes. The publication process has been greatly cleaned up and simplified. Deployments which have too many downloaders behind NAT can now keep them out with the tracker option, --nonat 1. This will hopefully be the last release with a version check on startup - if there are no big snags in the next deployment, the version check will be removed in the next release. 2.9.1 2002 July 4 Reporting of disk full and rejected by tracker has been fixed. Bitfields have been made big-endian for consistency. 2.9.6 2002 July 18 Fixed for all the tweaks and minor issues which showed up in the last trial run, and new support for building .debs. 3.0.1 2002 October 2 Minor cleanups, finalizing the protocol, and removal of version checking (which happened in release 3.0). 3.0.2 2002 November 5 A polished UI, improved upload and download rate estimation, a new GUI for making metainfo files, and some bugfixes. 3.1 2003 January 2 Massive performance improvements and some bugfixes were made. Some utilities were added. Upload rate capping was added. 3.2 2003 March 28 This release features massive performance improvements, and now supports read-only files. The Windows build now takes command-line parameters. There were also several bugfixes. 3.2.1b 2003 June 5 This version is enhanced with new features to make BitTorrent even more robust and easier to use. 3.3 2003 September 24 Files now only get allocated as they're downloaded, and don't fragment the hard drive. Large torrents no longer hose the CPU. Better network utilization and more consistent download rates have been achieved. Poorly seeded torrents now get out faster. Several important bugs were fixed. 3.4 2004 March 6 This version fixes bugs. The client no longer complains about tracker connection problems when transfers are still going. The bandwidth usage was reduced. 3.4.1 2004 March 11 This version fixes lots of bugs, adds more bandwidth savings, and improves support for peers behind dynamic IPs. 3.4.1a 2004 March 12 The tracker works under Python 2.2 and supports 3.3 clients properly. The client is unchanged. 3.4.2 2004 May 15 This release fixes some bugs (including an important tracker bug and a problem where some users got 'could not find file' messages) and adds warning message support, so trackers can send non-fatal human-readable messages to clients.", "t_headings": "[Public_domain|public domain] [Public_domain|public domain] [Public_domain|public domain]", "caption": "Release History"}}
