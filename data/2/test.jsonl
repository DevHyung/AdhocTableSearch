Ryan, an OxyContin addict, was in and out of treatment for months before dropping out entirely and hitting bottom as a homeless heroin addict on the streets of L.A. Now he's back in rehab at Oasis in Anaheim, California, a facility where he'd had previous clashes with the rehab director, under orders from a judge to stay in rehabilitation for one year or face a jail sentence for heroin possession and DUI conviction. Ryan, as in his earlier stints in rehab, openly refuses to conform to the facility's rules; the facility's director, speaking at a follow-up hearing after Ryan's first 60 days at Oasis, informs the judge of Ryan's continued rule-breaking and asks the judge to remind Ryan of the terms of the sentence. He will be kicked out of Oasis if he breaks one more rule or continues to defy the staff counselors and doctors. Ryan puts this to the test just six weeks later as he is kicked out of Oasis' Sober Living program for prank-calling his former girlfriend. Hubert, a former homeless alcoholic, is nine months sober and has a new job as well as a new home in a halfway house program called Clean and Sober Living. But he still struggles with the death of his stepfather, who finally admitted during the intervention that he had been a \\\"terrible father\\\" to Hubert; Hubert was able to fulfill his stepfather's dying wish\\u2013 to see Hubert sober\\u2013 by coming to his bedside just weeks into his rehab. Hubert also struggles with house rules about no interactions with people previously involved with possibly enabling the addicts, meaning he must avoid seeing old friend John, a fellow homeless person who often fed Hubert, bought alcohol and helped him find a safe place to sleep. John is equally sad about not being allowed to see Hubert, but acknowledges that if Hubert staying away from him is crucial to maintaining Hubert's sobriety, it is a small price to pay to save his life. As a gift to John for helping Hubert and his family come together for the intervention, the show's producers paid for John to have his badly misaligned and decaying teeth capped and replaced. At the time of filming, Hubert was celebrating reaching the nine-month sobriety milestone by watching his episode of Intervention with his siblings and housemates, with a goal to reach one year so \\\"I can get a cake\\\" (a tradition at Clean and Sober Living); in December 2007, Hubert successfully reached that milestone and got his cake.\", \"A look at how two people have fared since their interventions.

Ryan, as in his earlier stints in rehab, openly refuses to conform to the facility's rules; the facility's director, speaking at a follow-up hearing after Ryan's first 60 days at Oasis, informs the judge of Ryan's continued rule-breaking and asks the judge to remind Ryan of the terms of the sentence.

Hubert also struggles with house rules about no interactions with people previously involved with possibly enabling the addicts, meaning he must avoid seeing old friend John, a fellow homeless person who often fed Hubert, bought alcohol and helped him find a safe place to sleep. John is equally sad about not being allowed to see Hubert, but acknowledges that if Hubert staying away from him is crucial to maintaining Hubert's sobriety, it is a small price to pay to save his life. As a gift to John for helping Hubert and his family come together for the intervention, the show's producers paid for John to have his badly misaligned and decaying teeth capped and replaced. At the time of filming, Hubert was celebrating reaching the nine-month sobriety milestone by watching his episode of Intervention with his siblings and housemates, with a goal to reach one year so \\\"I can get a cake\\\" (a tradition at Clean and Sober Living); in December 2007, Hubert successfully reached that milestone and got his cake.\", \"A look at how two people have fared since their interventions.

Ryan, an OxyContin addict, was in and out of treatment for months before dropping out entirely and hitting bottom as a homeless heroin addict on the streets of L.A. Now he's back in rehab at Oasis in Anaheim, California, a facility where he'd had previous clashes with the rehab director, under orders from a judge to stay in rehabilitation for one year or face a jail sentence for heroin possession and DUI conviction. Ryan, as in his earlier stints in rehab, openly refuses to conform to the facility's rules; the facility's director, speaking at a follow-up hearing after Ryan's first 60 days at Oasis, informs the judge of Ryan's continued rule-breaking and asks the judge to remind Ryan of the terms of the sentence. He will be kicked out of Oasis if he breaks one more rule or continues to defy the staff counselors and doctors. Ryan puts this to the test just six weeks later as he is kicked out of Oasis' Sober Living program for prank-calling his former girlfriend. Hubert, a former homeless alcoholic, is nine months sober and has a new job as well as a new home in a halfway house program called Clean and Sober Living. But he still struggles with the death of his stepfather, who finally admitted during the intervention that he had been a \"terrible father\" to Hubert; Hubert was able to fulfill his stepfather's dying wish\u2013 to see Hubert sober\u2013 by coming to his bedside just weeks into his rehab. Hubert also struggles with house rules about no interactions with people previously involved with possibly enabling the addicts, meaning he must avoid seeing old friend John, a fellow homeless person who often fed Hubert, bought alcohol and helped him find a safe place to sleep. John is equally sad about not being allowed to see Hubert, but acknowledges that if Hubert staying away from him is crucial to maintaining Hubert's sobriety, it is a small price to pay to save his life. As a gift to John for helping Hubert and his family come together for the intervention, the show's producers paid for John to have his badly misaligned and decaying teeth capped and replaced. At the time of filming, Hubert was celebrating reaching the nine-month sobriety milestone by watching his episode of Intervention with his siblings and housemates, with a goal to reach one year so \"I can get a cake\" (a tradition at Clean and Sober Living); in December 2007, Hubert successfully reached that milestone and got his cake.

His parents split when Brad was young and his mother attempted to parentally abduct his younger twin sisters, leaving Brad behind with his father; despite evidence to the contrary, Brad's mother insists she never intended to abandon her son. Brad's father won custody of all three children and married his children's former babysitter. Brad self-medicated as a teen with marijuana to deal with the emotions left by his abandonment and his anger at his stepmother's attempts to enforce discipline. At 18, Brad's father ordered him to either leave home forever or sign up for the military; Brad chose the Army and came out of Basic Training seemingly a changed person. After two tours of duty in Operation Iraqi Freedom, however, Brad's tenuous hold on maturity and inner peace was shattered after Sgt. Deason, his commander, was killed on the last day of their second tours. Brad returned home suffering from serious PTSD. Unwilling to accept the drug and counseling therapy offered by the VA and unable to find a job because his Army skillset doesn't match current employer needs (\"Nobody wants to hire someone whose only job skill is killing people,\" Brad's dad notes), Brad gets a job as a stock clerk at a liquor store, self-medicates to deal with his pain and is now drinking over a pint of vodka per day and smoking any weed he can get his hands on. Brad wants to return to the Army Reserves, but Brad's family wants him to get past his PTSD and anger issues first. Epilogue: Brad left treatment after 21 days. His father refused to let him back in the house; he quit his job at a liquor store and moved in with friends. Though he continues to drink, he says he has cut down.

Unwilling to accept the drug and counseling therapy offered by the VA and unable to find a job because his Army skillset doesn't match current employer needs (\"Nobody wants to hire someone whose only job skill is killing people,\" Brad's dad notes), Brad gets a job as a stock clerk at a liquor store, self-medicates to deal with his pain and is now drinking over a pint of vodka per day and smoking any weed he can get his hands on. Brad wants to return to the Army Reserves, but Brad's family wants him to get past his PTSD and anger issues first. Epilogue: Brad left treatment after 21 days. His father refused to let him back in the house; he quit his job at a liquor store and moved in with friends. Though he continues to drink, he says he has cut down. 60 10 \"Lawrence\" [Substance_abuse|drug abuse] March17,2008 [Cirrhosis|cirrhosis] [Cirrhosis|cirrhosis] [Cirrhosis|cirrhosis] [Cirrhosis|cirrhosis] [Cirrhosis|cirrhosis]", "t_headings": "# # Subjects Addiction topics Original air date", "caption": "Season 4: 2007\u20132008"}}

They present their products to A&P CEO Sam Martin, as well as Tom Dahlen. Dahlen and Martin pick Tekisha's frozen cheesecake cookie sandwich - the Smoogy - as the show winner and it is announced that it is now available in select A&P stores.
